                <p>Research in visual perception suggests that humans may process images up to 60,000 times faster than text, a concept leveraged in advertising and media.
                    And yet, sometimes, words themselves can paint the most vivid picture. Words can express complex or abstract information in a way images cannot.Sometimes we need both.
                    
                    The Origin and Myth of the Thousand-Word Picture
                    The phrase a picture is worth a thousand words has two popular origin stories. One version credits advertising executive Frederick R. Barnard, who attributed the phrase to an ancient Chinese proverb.
                    
                    the Chinese derivation was pure invention. Many things had been thought to be ‘worth ten thousand words’ well before pictures got in on the act;” –The meaning and origin of the expression: A picture is worth a thousand words
                    
                     The Power of Visuals
                    The issue with saying “a picture is worth a thousand words” is it sets up a false battle between words and images. It suggests one image can match, replace, or outdo the impact of words. A claim that compares apples and oranges and contradicts our daily experience.
                    We all know the power of words.
                    We know that a handful of well-chosen words will say more than a waterfall of clichés.
                    We all know that one precise word can say more than 1,000 stock images.
                    
                    The Relationship Between Text and Visuals
                    Instead of pitching images and text against each other, we need to learn when to use which, and how to use both images and words to strengthen each other. Using your text and visuals in a way that complements each other can make or break the story you’re trying to tell.
                    
                    Minimalism in Storytelling
                    Effective storytelling, in text or visuals, says more with less. Using clear, focused messaging that focuses only on what’s important is key. In visual storytelling, presentations use meaningful, clear, focused images to guide the audience’s attention. Visuals grab your attention and directly impact your emotions.
                    
                    Now, Martin Luther King Jr.’s iconic “I Have a Dream” speech. The image of Dr. King standing before the Washington Monument delivering his speech in front of a sea of people captures the intensity of the moment.
                    Dos and Don’ts for Achieving Balance

                    <p>1. Prioritize Information
                        A few carefully chosen words can say what 1,000 stock images cannot. The right image can counter cynicism, closed-mindedness, or an automatic dismissal of a convincing argument. Now, think about how the images and text come together to prove your point. Image and text can convince in a way that they couldn’t on their own.
                        Don’t read text from your slides.
                        Don’t write next to the image that people already see.
                        And don’t repeat in spoken words what your image shows.
                        
                        2. Choose visuals that tell a story
                        
                        
                        3. Be careful when adding one picture after the other
                        
                        
                        4. Rehearse to Get a Feeling for the Impact of the Images
                        5. Ask Others How They Feel About Your Visuals
                         The Art and Science of Balanced Storytelling
                        Ironically, the phrase “A picture is worth 1,000 words” doesn’t come close to showing the whole picture. Text and image content both have their strengths and limitations.
                        Pictures have an impact when they tell a story that only a picture can tell. Ideally, you find the right words to enhance the said impact. Choose your images as carefully as you chose your words. If you don’t have a meaningful picture, don’t use a placeholder just to add color. You dilute your message, distract from what you want to say, and choose anything but the best means to communicate disrespect to your audience.
